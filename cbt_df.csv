He is angry with me.,"There are many reasons why Helen's husband has not called her. It could be that he has a crazy busy day at work or he forgot or lost his phone somewhere. Also just because her husband has not called her yet, doesn't mean he is angry at her. He may be in a situation when he hasn't been able to call her yet. He may call her later when he finds the time and place."
Helen’s husband has not called her yet today.,Romantic,"Sad, Fearful, ",He is angry with me.,"Jumping to Conclusions (Mind Reading), ",cbt,Helen’s husband has not called her yet today. He is angry with me.,"First it all depends on the situation: if everything is going well between them she should just think he is been very busy with work, with the kids homeworks, with his friends, helping his parents , he is at a class, busy as well in his own world (reading, listening to music, dancing, etc) 
She should think: i am happy he is busy with something else, he will call me back when he will be free and without any danger (crossing the road, in the middle of a meeting, driving, while watching the kids, etc)"

He is angry with me.,"Well, my husband seems upset but I haven't done anything to him. He may have had a bad day at work, or maybe something could be troubling him. Better talk to him to check it out."

He is angry with me.,"The fact that he has not called doesn't mean in any way that he is angry.

Helen’s husband has not called her yet today.,Romantic,"Sad, Fearful, ",He is angry with me.,"Jumping to Conclusions (Mind Reading), ",cbt,Helen’s husband has not called her yet today. He is angry with me.,"We didnt have any argument last night or this morning and we did not part in anger or frustration this morning. There is no reason, why he should be angry with me.
It is more probable that something at work keeps him completely busy and if he is indeed annoyed, he is annoyed by work or something connected with it. 
If he doesnt call, then probably because he doesnt have a single minute to himself and I know that he doesnt like to call me when he is all angry with stuff from work because he risks growling at me without reason.
Also, while he usually calls me from work, we didnt have an appointment or anything like that,- so, he didnt have to call for cancelling anything either."

Helen’s husband has not called her yet today.,Romantic,"Sad, Fearful, ",I'm not a good wife.,"Labeling, Mental Filter, ",cbt,Helen’s husband has not called her yet today. I'm not a good wife.,"To not be a good wife, you have to be so horrible to your husband. Helen is upset and can only see the negative in her.  She could be a great wife most of the times and may be she made one or two mistakes. That does not make her not a good wife. No on is perfect and it is OK to make mistakes because it is how we learn to be better.  Helen should look at the big picture of how she is as a wife rather than only focus on one or two negative instances."

Helen’s husband has not called her yet today.,Romantic,"Sad, Fearful, ",I'm not a good wife.,"Labeling, Mental Filter, ",cbt,Helen’s husband has not called her yet today. I'm not a good wife.,"Being a good wife is about day to day life, her worry shows that she cares about him, so probably she is a good wife. Him not calling can have many reasons and is not related to their relationship. Her distress shows she misses confidence in herself, instead of creating different scenarios, she might try to call him instead."
Helen’s husband has not called her yet today.,Romantic,"Sad, Fearful, ",I'm not a good wife.,"Labeling, Mental Filter, ",cbt,Helen’s husband has not called her yet today. I'm not a good wife.,He has married a person with feelings and emotions like him.  He knows your weaknesses and strengths and marries you anyway
Helen’s husband has not called her yet today.,Romantic,"Sad, Fearful, ",I'm not a good wife.,"Labeling, Mental Filter, ",cbt,Helen’s husband has not called her yet today. I'm not a good wife.,"I am sad that he is not calling me, because I like to hear him, I like when we talk and I am worried that he is bothered at work. I know all that. But its work and he doesnt control all things which come his way there and so he is just not able to call now.
I know that he usually calls,- so, that he doesnt call today is clearly a sign that he is much stressed at work,- if he could, he would call because he knows I am waiting for him. He doesnt do that deliberately, he is a good man but not perfect. And thats not necessary because neither am I. Maybe he just forgot to charge the phone, as I once did and caused him so much worry.
We are not perfect but we fit perfectly to each other."

Soon after you get there, you have the urge to leave because you feel anxious and defensive. This party will be a drag.",I am trying to find an excuse not to go to this party as I am just dreaming of staying home under my blanket watching netflix. I need to be more open minded and take more initiatives: if I want something in life or have a goal I need to work towards it. I cannot complain all the time i am single if I dont even make the effort to meet people. I need to boost myself and go to the party so I wont regret it afterwards. I could meet very interesting people and some could even become friends. I dont need to put pressure on myself to find absolutely someone tonight; I can just relax and enjoy some nice socialising and music. I should not have high expectations as otherwise I will also be disappointed if I dont meet anyone I like. This could be a way for me to meet new people but also to gain more confidence and learn something. It is also an opportunity to maybe meet someone I could fancy and be in a relationship with so instead of finding excuses I should at least try to see by myself!

It is also possible that he is stressed by talking about their problems in the relationship, because he is afraid of quarrels. Of course, the wife should quietly try to talk to him, say that it is necessary for further functioning in the relationship. In my experience, my dad doesn't want to talk to my mom about problems either because he is tired of how mom gets nervous during such a conversation and accuses my dad of various things without looking at his good sides.

It is best not to say things under the influence of emotions.It is best to explain calmly what is in our hearts, or to offer marriage therapy. Every relationship has problems and this is normal. It is possible that the husband did not respond to the statement about being a co-roommate because he did not take it seriously, he probably thought that his wife only wanted to scare him.  Surely, people lose credibility when they say things that are not covered. I think that a husband certainly loves his wife, otherwise he would have agreed to the proposal to be a co-roommate.
